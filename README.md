# Smart Home Energy Management System

## Overview
The **Smart Home Energy Management System** (SHEMS) is a software solution designed to optimize energy consumption in smart homes. It leverages design patterns to improve system efficiency, scalability, and maintainability. The system monitors energy usage, provides smart recommendations, and integrates with IoT devices for automated control.

## Features
- **Real-time energy monitoring**: Tracks energy consumption across different devices.
- **Automated scheduling**: Optimizes appliance usage based on energy rates and user preferences.
- **AI-driven recommendations**: Suggests energy-saving strategies.
- **Remote control**: Allows users to manage devices via a mobile/web application.
- **Alerts and notifications**: Provides warnings for excessive energy consumption.
- **Integration with renewable energy sources**: Supports solar panels and battery storage systems.

## Design Patterns Used
### 1. **Singleton Pattern**
   - Ensures a single instance of the energy management controller for consistent system state.
### 2. **Observer Pattern**
   - Facilitates real-time updates by notifying users and connected devices of energy consumption changes.
### 3. **Factory Pattern**
   - Simplifies the creation of different types of smart devices (e.g., thermostats, smart plugs, and lights) while maintaining flexibility.
### 4. **Strategy Pattern**
   - Provides different energy-saving strategies that users can select based on their preferences.
### 5. **Command Pattern**
   - Enables remote control of devices by encapsulating commands such as turning devices on/off.
### 6. **Adapter Pattern**
   - Allows seamless integration of third-party IoT devices with different communication protocols.
### 7. **Proxy Pattern**
   - Ensures secure access control by mediating requests between the user interface and the underlying system.
